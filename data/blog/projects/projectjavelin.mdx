## Overview

Project Javelin was created as a senior project for the company [Fanalyze](https://www.fanalyze.com/).
I joined up with a team of 7 other seniors studying Computer Science at Sacramento State
University and we built this over a 4 month period. To get some more insight on the project and the
team members, check out our senior project website

## Project Requirements

Our client currently has a product that is centered around data aggregation for sports betting for major US sports.
He came to us with this idea of creating a data aggregation app based upon the Olympics that gives users real time
updates about events and athletes. He also wanted to integrate an external source of social media into the app, like
Tik Tok, YouTube, or Twitter. So with those requirements in place we began to prototyping potential solutions.

## Prototyping

It was during this process that we had to clarify what
the client actually wanted and what we could accomplish in the time span that we had, 3 months to build in total.
We also had to think about if the user should have to create an account to use the app, how we should store any user
data if we do have users creating accounts, and different sign in methods. Another issue we needed to reason through
was what users should be notified about. Some people are going to want to be notified about different sports so we
couldn't just implement a one size fits all notification type. With all of these things in mind, we decided that we
needed to have users sign in to create an account, users should be able to choose if they want to be notified about
any events or athletes, and users should be able to follow different events, athletes, and countries. We also thought
that users should be able to search for different countries, athletes, and events so we needed to implement some search
functionality. Some other cool features that we could implement were a map that tracks the location of the Olympic torch
and a screen that allows users to compare the stats between two different athletes. In addition to these requirements,
we also needed screens that gave detailed information on athletes and countries, such as the amount of medals a person
has and the upcoming events for a country. On top of all this, we needed to figure out where the external social media
should be implemented. We the home screen as a temporary solution, but knew that we'd have to get deeper into the project
in order to determine the best spot for it. So with all of these things taken into account, the prototype below is what
we came up with.
