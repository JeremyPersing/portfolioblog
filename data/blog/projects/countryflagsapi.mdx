## Introduction

I created [countryflagsapi.com](https://www.countryflagsapi.com) because I was working on
a project that needed the flags for various different countries. The API that we were using
at the time went offline, so we had to download the 250+ country flags and incorporate them
into our app. Now this wasn't so bad, but one problem that we faced was that the files were
downloaded in ISO Alpha-2 format (ex: us.png), while our data was giving us a butchered version
of ISO Alpha-3 codes to identify countries. This led to having to the time intensive task of translating
each code from the butchered ISO Alpha-3 to ISO Alpha-2 using a hashmap. I fidn't want anyone else to have
to go thrugh this tedious process so that is why [countryflagsapi.com](https://www.countryflagsapi.com) was created.

## Architecture & Deployment

I used Express to created the backend for the app, and am just serving static html files for the frontend. Being that
there are only 254 countries, I'm not using any database for the API, so everything is stored locally. The backend is deployed on
Heroku free tier right now and I'm using Cloudflare's free SSL certificate. I'm also using Cloudflare to manage the DNS.
