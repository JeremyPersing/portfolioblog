# CountryFlagsAPI.com by Jeremy Persing

## Introduction

I created [countryflagsapi.com](https://www.countryflagsapi.com) because I was working on
a project that needed the flags for various different countries. The API that we were using
at the time went offline, so we had to download the 250+ country flags and incorporate them
into our app. Now this wasn't so bad, but one problem that we faced was that the files were
downloaded in ISO Alpha-2 format (ex: us.png), while our data was giving us a butchered version
of ISO Alpha-3 codes to identify countries. This led to having to the time intensive task of translating
each code from the butchered ISO Alpha-3 to ISO Alpha-2 using a hashmap. I don't want you to have
to go through that painful and tedious process,
so that is why [countryflagsapi.com](https://www.countryflagsapi.com) was created.
