draft: false
summary: 'I built this project after college where I had to join a team of other students in building out an olympics app in React Native.
A lot of the tutorials I had come accross while doing this were "half-baked", so I thought I ought to build a real world project and show others how they could do the 
same.'

## Background

Prior to creating this project I had worked on a React Native/Expo project and noticed that most, if not all, of the video tutorials online used Firebase in their implementation of things. I found this to be annoying at times, because my team wasn't using Firebase and there was no variety in tutorials for implementing things. Also, finding a genuine implementation for Expo Push Notifications on YouTube was impossible at that time. Luckily the expo documentation had everything that we needed, but at the end of that experience I thought that it would be useful to show that you don't just have to use Firebase when building out your React Native project.

## The Project

The app that I drew inspiration from was Apartments.com's mobile app. Prior to making the project, I had seen that they were able to sell their business for $500 - 600 million in the mid 2010's, yet when you look at their app it is relatively simple. Of course the value of the business probably had more to do with the number of users, revenue generated, and the data they had. But the point still remained that building out an app similar to theirs was very feasible. This video is me going through that process, and showing you how you can do the same.
