## Overview

This was the final project that I created for my compiler class.
The compiler that I built was written in the C language and converts
a subset of the C language, Baby C, to an intermediary assembly language
known as ILOC. It works by taking input from a file, then uses a software
called FLEX to scan the file. After this I generate an LR(1) grammar, I use another
another software called YACC and an abstract syntax tree (AST) gets created.
Based off of this AST, I use depth first search and recursion to create ILOC.
I keep track of variable names and assignments by using a lookup table.
Due to the nature of this assignment, I used a linked list for the lookup table
because of it was simple to implement. However, the lookup table would have been
more efficient if I used a hash table instead. Overall, this project taught me
a lot about data structures, algorithms, and the compilation process.

## What I Learned

- Became more comfortable developing in the C language and using pointers
- Practical uses for algorithms such as Depth First Search
- Practical uses for data structures such as linked lists, hash tables, graphs, and trees
- The compilation process
- Regular expressions and how to create grammars in code
- LR(1) and LL(1) parsing
