## Overview

Prior to running this program I had only seen a few reviews on it, so I figured it would be a good challenge to run it and then put my review out there.
The program would only be 6 weeks long, so if things went south it wouldn't be for that long.
Another reason for running it was to put on some mass and gain some strength. I think it did just that, so let's dive into the results.

## The Results

### Training Maxes

I used about 85% of a true max (based upon my 90% number) for the squat, bench, and press. I kept the 90% training max for the deadlift, but should have lowered it to 85%.

| Lift     | Before (lbs) | After (lbs) |
| -------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Squat    | 360          | 370         |
| Bench    | 250          | 255         |
| Deadlift | 455          | 465         |
| Press    | 160          | 165         |

### New Maxes

I can't say for certain what my maxes were prior to the program, but all across the board I have hit lifetime pr's on all lifts after it.
So I'll just list my previous lifetime pr and the new one.

| Lift     | Before (lbs)      | After (lbs)                                         |
| -------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Squat    | (300 x 20) -> 435 | 315 x 19 -> Didn't Test                             |
| Bench    | 295               | 325                                                 |
| Deadlift | 500               | 505 (probably could have done more, but failed 545) |

### Measurements (Unflexxed)
