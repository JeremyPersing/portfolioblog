## Overview

So most of the dokku tutorials that I've seen all use DigitalOcean and rarely use any other
cloud platform. Because of this, I thought that I should detail the steps that I took to set
up dokku on an AWS EC2 instance. If you're in the same situation or that sounds interesting to
you, then keep on reading.

## Step 1 - Creating an EC2 Instance

Navigate to AWS and create yourself a free Ubuntu instance, I used version 20.04 LTS.
The instructions that I took to do this are somewhere along the lines of this:

- click the "Launch instance" button
- type Ubuntu in the search bar
- Select 20.04 LTS
- Select t2.micro
- Click Review and Launch
- Edit Security groups
- Click add rule
  - In the Type column, select HTTP (allow inbound traffic on port 80), and it should autofill to allow all IPs
- Click add rule
  - In the Type column, select HTTPS (allow inbound traffic on port 443), and it should autofill to allow all IPs
- Click Launch
- Either create a new SSH key pair and download it or if you have an existin gpair downloaded
  that you want to use then you can use that pair

There might be a step or two that I missed in there, but if you follow those general guidlines then
you should have a new EC2 instance up and running.

## Step 2 - Connecting to Your EC2 Instance

Navigate back to your instances and then click on the hyperlinked instance id. Information about the instance's IP address
and other information should pop up. Click on connect and then click on the SSH tab. Following the instructions that are
listed there. If you're on Windows, you can use PuTTY or Powershell to SSH into your EC2 instance.

## Step 3 - Installing Dokku

The first thing you should do is run `sudo apt-get update` to update any packages that have updates available. After that
is done, if you are using Ubuntu or Debian you can follow the steps listed below, otherwise you should follow the steps
for installing that are listed here [https://dokku.com/](https://dokku.com/).

```
 wget -nv -O - https://get.docker.com/ | sh
 wget -nv -O - https://packagecloud.io/dokku/dokku/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
 export SOURCE="https://packagecloud.io/dokku/dokku/ubuntu/"
 export OS_ID="$(lsb_release -cs 2>/dev/null || echo "bionic")"
 echo "bionic focal" | grep -q "$OS_ID" || OS_ID="bionic"
 echo "deb $SOURCE $OS_ID main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dokku.list
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install dokku
 sudo dokku plugin:install-dependencies --core
```

- enable nginx-vhosts plugin - yes
- Hostname or IP for server - use a domain if you have one, otherwise you can leave it and we'll change it later
- enable vhost-based deployments - I put yes, but if you don't want subdomains and prefer to have different dokku
  instance listed on different ports choose no. Here's the [docs on it](https://dokku.com/docs/configuration/domains/#disabling-vhosts)
- keyfile for initial user - I'm not changing anything so going with Ok (both times)

With these steps done, dokku should now be installed on your EC2 instance.

## Step 4 - Create a Dokku App

In your EC2 instance run the command `dokku apps:create appname` to create an app.

# The steps after this point can happen in any order

## Step 5 - Create or Add an SSH Key for Your Dokku Instance

Use ssh-keygen or PuTTY to create an SSH key on your local machine. This ssh key is created so that you can push to the dokku instance. Once you've created an
SSH key, you need to get the public key onto the dokku instance. You can do this with this command
`cat /path/to/ssh-key-for-dokku | ssh -i "/Path/To/EC2/ssh-key" serverIP-Or-URL sudo dokku ssh-keys:add keyname`
For a more "real life" example, here is the command that I used on a previous EC2 instance.
`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -i "C:\Users\Jeremy\Downloads\test.pem" ubuntu@ec2-4-73-14-162.compute-1.amazonaws.com sudo dokku ssh-keys:add jeremy`

## Step 6 - Push Your code

Head to the repository that you want to push to your server and run the command `git remote add dokku dokku@serverIP:dokkuAppName`
Then run the typical git commands

- git add .
- git commit -m "some message"
- git push dokku master

If everything is configured correctly, you should see that your code is getting pushed to your server in a fashion that
is very similar to Heroku. At the end of the displayed outcome you will see the url for where your ap is deployed. Now at this point, if you
don't have a domain and went with the default configuration while setting up dokku, you wont be able to get to your app.
There are two ways you can fix this. You can either use your IP address for the domain or you can get domain. If you choose to only use
your IP, you're going to be hardpressed when it comes down to enbaling https (or at least I was). So let's get a free domain.

## Step 7 - Free domain

Go to [freenom.com](https://freenom.com) and type in a domain name. Once you've found a free one that you like, enter in the
full domain (ie somefreedomain.ml) into the searchbar and you should see that it becomes available. Go through the process of
acquiring the domain (watch the video above if you need more help) and sign into your account. Once inside your account, head to the
part where you can change nameservers. Next, create a Cloudflare account and add the domain that you just created. Add an A record that
points to your server's IP address. Then change the nameservers in freenom. Once this is done, configure cloudflare such that it is proxying
and only allows for https.

## Step 8 - Changing the dokku domains

Go back to your EC2 terminal and run `dokku domains:set-global yourdomainname` and `dokku domains:set appname yourdomainname`.
This should allow you to now see your app, but if you can't see your app try to restart it by running `dokku ps:rebuild` appname.

## Step 9 - Environment variables

If your app still isn't working then make sure that you have environment variables set. You can do this with the command of
`dokku config:set appname KEY=value` but I would recommend you add in the `--no-restart` tag because not adding it cause me
some headaches because my server would get stuck compiling typescript and I would have to stop it and then start it again. The
bad thing is that when you stop and start your server, the IP address changes, which is problematic because I then had to change
the remote git address and go modify my ssh connection strings as they were also different.
_Recommended command_: `dokku config:set --no-restart appname KEY=value`
