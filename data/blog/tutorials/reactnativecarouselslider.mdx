## Overview

Recently I was looking to create something like this.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/static/images/ebayCarouselSlider.gif" alt="eBay gif" width="250" />
</div>

After doing some research, I figured out that the best way to achieve this would be to
not rely on a third party library and just use React Native components to get the job done.
This is what I ended up creating.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/static/images/carouselSlider.gif" alt="final result" width="250" />
</div>

## Getting Started

I'm going to assume that you already have your own project setup

## Step 1

Go to [postmail.invotes.com](https://postmail.invotes.com/) and enter your email
in the input with the placeholder "Your contact email." Press "Go" and check your
inbox for an access token.

## Step 2

Add the following code to your HTML file.

```html
<form action="https://postmail.invotes.com/send" method="post" id="email_form">
  <input type="text" name="subject" placeholder="Subject" />
  <textarea name="text" placeholder="Message"></textarea>
  <input type="hidden" name="access_token" value="your_access_token" />

  <input type="hidden" name="success_url" value="." />
  <input type="hidden" name="error_url" value=".?err=1" />

  <input id="submit_form" type="submit" value="Send" />
</form>
```

Then replace the value "your_access_token" with the access token that got
sent to you. I would also suggest changing the success_url and error_url values
to the values that are unique to your application.

## Step 3

Add some styles to the new inputs and test it out to make sure that it works. You should
receive a new email when a new message is sent.
