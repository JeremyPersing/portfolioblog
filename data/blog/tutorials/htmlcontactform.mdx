## Overview

Recently I was working on a project and I wanted users to be able
to get into contact with me if they wanted adjustments to be made to the site.
My initial idea was to add a database and implement a trigger to notify me whenever
a new comment gets made. However, that seemed like overkill and I would have been
using email to notify myself anyways, so I decided to go with an email solution.
This is the process of how I implemented that solution.

## Step 1

Go to [postmail.invotes.com](https://postmail.invotes.com/) and enter your email
in the input with the placeholder "Your contact email." Press "Go" and check your
inbox for an access token.

## Step 2

Add the following code to your HTML file.

```html
<form action="https://postmail.invotes.com/send" method="post" id="email_form">
  <input type="text" name="subject" placeholder="Subject" />
  <textarea name="text" placeholder="Message"></textarea>
  <input type="hidden" name="access_token" value="your_access_token" />

  <input type="hidden" name="success_url" value="." />
  <input type="hidden" name="error_url" value=".?err=1" />

  <input id="submit_form" type="submit" value="Send" />
</form>
```

Then replace the value "your_access_token" with the access token that got
sent to you. I would also suggest changing the success_url and error_url values
to the values that are unique to your application.

## Step 3

Add some styles to the new inputs and test it out to make sure that it works. You should
receive a new email when a new message is sent.
