I am a curious person by nature, often wanting to know the why and how over everything else.
I also love problem solving. There is no better feeling of accomplishment than observing a
problem, devising a solution, and then executing.
My favorite subjects to learn about are technology, investing, history, economics,
and astronomy. I've got a BS in Computer Science from CSU Sacramento and graduated
with a 3.85 GPA. My favorite domains within tech are web and application development,
data visualization, database management, and blockchain technology.
